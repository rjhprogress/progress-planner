# progress-planner

Add important events to a daily planner so that you can manage time more effectively.  
This application uses the [Moment.js] (https://momentjs.com) library to work with date and time in the browswer. 
Each block is color-coded to indicate whether it is the past, present, or future
Text entered into each time block can be saved to that time block. 
Local storage enables each event to remain saved even after the page is refreshed.
